## Governance 

MOR Labs employs a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Trinity DAO, which utilizes a sub-DAO structure with clearly defined responsibilities. This structure allows each sub-DAO to operate and execute tasks swiftly.

Trinity DAO, governed by token holders, possesses the authority to veto any proposal, should the need arise. This mechanism ensures that sub-DAOs operate with agility and flexibility while remaining aligned with the interests of Trinity DAO and its token holders.

Each sub-DAO has its own council that oversees contributors and manages critical infrastructure related to that particular sub-DAO. The members of each council are elected by Trinity DAO, with their responsibilities and term outlined in a contract stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

Furthermore, a community multisig can be employed to execute transactions within any sub-DAO, should a critical intervention be required. 

The organisational hierarchy of Trinity DAO is shown below.

Each contributor to Trinity DAO is provided with a HAT NFT, powered by [Hats Protocol](https://hatsprotocol.xyz), which grants them with special access permissions tailored towards their role.
