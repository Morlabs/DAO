## Governance 

MOR Labs employs a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Trinity DAO, which utilizes a sub-DAO structure with clearly defined responsibilities. This structure allows each sub-DAO to operate and execute tasks swiftly.

Trinity DAO, governed by token holders, possesses the authority to veto any proposal, should the need arise. This mechanism ensures that sub-DAOs operate with agility and flexibility while remaining aligned with the interests of Trinity DAO and its token holders.

Each sub-DAO has its own council that oversees contributors and manages critical infrastructure related to that particular sub-DAO. The members of each council are elected by Trinity DAO, with their responsibilities and term outlined in a contract stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

Furthermore, a community multisig can be employed to execute transactions within any sub-DAO, should a critical intervention be required. 

The organisational hierarchy of Trinity DAO is shown below.

Each contributor to Trinity DAO is provided with a HAT NFT, powered by [Hats Protocol](https://hatsprotocol.xyz), which grants them with special access permissions tailored towards their role. 

## Sub-DAOs and Their Responsibilities

1. **Tech Sub-DAO**
   - Develop and maintain the DAO's technological infrastructure.
   - Ensure security and efficiency of the DAO's digital assets.
   - Foster innovation in blockchain, AI/ML, and data science.
   - Implement new features and designs collaboratively.
   - Guide the technical direction and strategy.

2. **DeFi Sub-DAO**
   - Develop investment strategies for the DAO's assets.
   - Ensure regulatory compliance and manage risks.
   - Analyze market trends to optimize investment returns.
   - Facilitate governance and decision-making processes.
   - Educate the community on DeFi concepts.

3. **Community & Education Sub-DAO**
   - Engage and grow the community through events and discussions.
   - Develop and distribute educational content on blockchain and DeFi.
   - Gather and analyze product feedback to improve user experience.
   - Foster a collaborative environment for learning and innovation.
   - Represent community interests in governance discussions.

4. **Ethics & Compliance Sub-DAO**
   - Advise on ethical practices in AI and blockchain development.
   - Ensure operations adhere to relevant regulations and guidelines.
   - Develop ethical and compliance frameworks, policies, and guidelines.
   - Educate members on ethical considerations and compliance matters.
   - Integrate ethics and compliance considerations into DAO activities.

5. **Talent & Knowledge Sub-DAO**
   - Attract, recruit, and retain talent to meet the DAO's needs.
   - Manage knowledge transfer and documentation to preserve organizational memory.
   - Implement smooth offboarding processes for departing members.
   - Curate and maintain a comprehensive knowledge base.
   - Identify talent needs and knowledge gaps within the organization.

6. **Product Sub-DAOs**
   - Define product visions and roadmaps for the DAO's digital offerings.
   - Oversee the development and management of platforms and marketplaces.
   - Gather and prioritize user requirements and feedback.
   - Monitor product performance and user satisfaction.
   - Drive product success through collaboration with other sub-DAOs.

The Product Sub-DAOs within Trinity DAO operate under a model similar to the "pizza team" concept, emphasizing the importance of small, agile teams. This approach is based on the idea that a team should be small enough that it could be fed with just two pizzas. The philosophy behind this is to keep teams lean and agile, fostering enhanced communication, collaboration, and efficiency.

In these Product Sub-DAOs, teams are comprised of cross-domain experts who bring together diverse skills and perspectives needed to develop, manage, and optimize the DAO's digital products. This setup ensures that each team member plays a crucial role, contributing their unique expertise while working closely with others to achieve common goals.

Such a configuration allows for:
- **Rapid Decision-Making:** Smaller teams can make decisions more quickly without the need for extensive meetings or layers of approval.
- **Increased Accountability:** With fewer members, each individual's contributions are more visible, increasing ownership and accountability for the project's success.
- **Better Communication:** A tighter-knit group facilitates easier and more effective communication, reducing the chances of misunderstandings and ensuring everyone is on the same page.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Small teams can adapt more quickly to changes or pivot their strategy based on feedback and market dynamics.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Cross-domain experts can more easily share knowledge and collaborate on solutions, leading to innovative approaches and problem-solving.

By adopting the pizza team concept, Product Sub-DAOs are able to operate more dynamically, making them well-suited to the fast-paced and ever-evolving landscape of blockchain and decentralized projects. This approach not only streamlines product development processes but also aligns with the decentralized and autonomous ethos of DAOs.
